# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create TypeScript Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up TypeScript configuration with strict type checking and modern development options
# Details:
Create tsconfig.json with compiler options for modern development including strict type checking, module resolution, and path mapping. Configure for Node.js development with ES2022 target, module resolution node, and enable decorators. Set up paths for clean imports and configure include/exclude patterns for src directory.

# Test Strategy:
Validate TypeScript configuration by running 'npx tsc --noEmit' and creating test TypeScript files with imports, exports, and strict type checking scenarios
