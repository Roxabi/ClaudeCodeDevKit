# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Basic Project Structure
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up src directory with separate frontend and backend subdirectories to accommodate future expansion
# Details:
Create src/ directory with frontend/ and backend/ subdirectories to establish clear separation of concerns. Add placeholder files in each subdirectory to demonstrate the structure and prepare for future development. The structure should be extensible to accommodate additional folders like shared/, utils/, or services/ as the project grows.

# Test Strategy:
Validate project structure by checking directory creation, verifying placeholder files exist, and ensuring the structure supports both frontend and backend development patterns
